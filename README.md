# js-fizzbuzz
Some FizzBuzz examples, written in JavaScript.

### What is it?
ItÂ´s just some source code of 2 very basic and simple sample FizzBuzz implementations, i did for fun.  
It contains
- a 26 codelines example ("_fizzbuzz-simple.js_")
- a 90 codelines example ("_fizzbuzz-complex.js_")

### What does it?
It just runs the good ol' FizzBuzz game/test.
- The 26 codelines example is a straight-one-function approach.
- The 90 codelines example is a more modular, configurable and functional approach.

### How to use it?
- Just download the source code.
- Open Console, or Powershell, or Terminal and navigate to the download folder.
- Run `node app`
- For everything else just take a look into the code. As i said, its really very basic.

Have fun.
